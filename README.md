Voice-First AI Business Buddy
A simple voice + chat-based AI assistant that works like a digital munim (accountant + helper) in local language (Hinglish to start).
What it does:
📊 Tracks Sales & Expenses by Voice
 Shopkeeper just speaks:
 “50 samose beche, 1000 rupaye aaye” → AI logs it in sales table.
 “Aaj aloo 400 rupaye ke kharide” → AI logs it as an expense.


📈 Gives Daily/Weekly Summaries
 “Kal ka hisaab batao” → AI reads out profits/losses in Hinglish + shows tables and charts side by side.


🤖 Forecasts Stock & Expenses
 “Monday bikri kam hoti hai, sirf ₹2000 ka stock lena.”
 Detects cost spikes (“Oil price badh gaya, kharcha 15% zyada hai.”).


🧠 Shows Real Tables for Trust
 All entries appear in sales, expenses, and revenue tables → so shopkeepers can cross-check what the AI says.


What makes it unique:
Voice-first adoption for shopkeepers who aren’t comfortable typing.


Local-language nudges in Hinglish → feels natural and human.


Forecasting (stock + expenses) → goes beyond just record-keeping.


Transparency → shows actual data behind every AI suggestion.


This makes the system feel like a friendly helper — not a “black box” — which builds trust.
